## Security Best Practices

To help secure your Angular project, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update your project dependencies to the latest versions.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure your application is served over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- **Sanitize inputs**: Always sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Use CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.
- **Regularly review code**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix potential security issues.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
